This is taken from the thumb of Michigan, at Port Austin looking back toward Saginaw Bay.
It was taken by me while on a mini getaway. June 2010. 
It's not perhaps coinciding with this theme, but nice never the less.

The wallpaper that inspired this theme is by a professional photographer and can be downloaded here;

It is called Ventanas by Noaclick. Be sure to check out some of his other work, mostly black and white
and very artistic.
